# 🚀 COVID-19 Analysis Using SQL and Power BI 🚀

I’m excited to share my latest project where I combined multiple Covid-19 datasets and utilized SQL for data analysis, with advanced data modeling and visualizations in Power BI. This project explores the impact, trends, and responses to the pandemic across various countries.

## 🗂️ Key Highlights:

⤷ **Data Integration:** Combined datasets on Covid-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing, and hospitalizations for a comprehensive analysis.

⤷ **SQL Mastery:** Executed SQL queries to uncover critical insights, such as identifying countries with the highest hospitalization rates and analyzing the correlation between testing and case detection.

⤷ **Power BI Visualization:** Developed a robust data model to visualize and communicate trends effectively.

## 🔍 Insightful Queries Addressed:

➤ Which country had the highest number of Covid-19 cases on a single day?

➤ What was the average number of deaths per day in April 2021?

➤ Analyzed the relationship between testing rates and case detection rates to identify potential underreporting.

## Why This Project Matters:

This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be used to provide data-driven insights into global health crises. By analyzing Covid-19 data, we can better understand trends and responses, contributing to more informed decision-making.
